## TODO:

- [WSL] exa is really slow right now with the -l option. I'm using -1 option for now, but I should change it back in exa version 0.11.0 (this improvement is marked for that version miletone)
- [Windows] Install required fonts
- [WSL] Install shfmt so that bat-extras can be minified
- [Windows] Configure symlinks
- [Windows] Configure Windows Terminal
- [WSL] Find a way to use the trash, so I don't use rm directly
