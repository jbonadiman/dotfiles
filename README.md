TODO:

- bat is really slow right now with the -l option. I'm using -1 option for now, but I should change it back in bat version 0.11.0 (this improvement is marked for that version miletone).
- Fix exes execution through WSL, so I can setup the winget to install MS Store Apps.
- Install required fonts.
- Set locale only if not previously set.
- Install bat-extras manually. I also need to install shfmt so that bat-extras can be minified.
